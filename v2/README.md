# GameVentory

Take the stress out of planning a board game night! GameVentory allows you to track your own game inventory and see what games your friends have in their collections. Have a game you really want to play? See if anyone in your network owns it! Request a game night for it. Not sure what to play or what to bring to a friends house? Have players propose games and vote on what to play.
